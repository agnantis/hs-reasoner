# hs-reasoner

## Brief Description

A Haskell implementation of an OWL 2 DL Reasoner.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to experiment the possibilities that Functional Programming offers related to the implementation of reasoning algorithms. As most well known reasoners are written in imperative languages like _C++_ (e.g. FaCT++) or _Java_ (Hermit, Pellet), using a functional paradigm may help us develop features that are not easily implemented in using the imperative way.
